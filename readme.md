# What is this?

I'm building a simple CLI RPG in Golang to learn the ropes with the langauge. The plan is to have a series of tiles connected through doors at each cardinal direction. The player's goal is to collect as much treasure as possible without being defeated by the monsters.

Each dungeon will be different, as will the monsters in each room during each playthrough. **LIMITLESS FUN HAVING POTENTIAL**

## How to play!

As the project progresses, I'll add some more details about how to actually play the game here!


## Goals for the project

1. To develop a better understanding of Golang
2. Allow the player to save and reload the game if they want to take a break
3. Have the game be even slightly fun
